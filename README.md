# Fortissimo
A guitar hero-like game, my 2009 senior project (team of 4). Recently resurrected in XNA 4.0, which is required to build.

Can be run with keyboard (ASDFG to fret, space/up/down to strum). Copyrighted music has been excluded from the project, specifically
.ogg files for each song. Files from Guitar Hero games can be directly imported (.ogg and .mid needed).

This code was written by 4 undergrads, and it shows in many places. List of bugs/enhancements I've noticed are listed at the top of RhythmGame.cs.
